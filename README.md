# Summary
Greetings I am Jamari Herbert and i am an 11th greader. Outside of school I am an artist. The type of art I do is drawing and music.
I resently got into story making as well. I drew mangas as well as started to voice act with my twin cousin for our animated series.

For one of the Mangas I am making is base on [What if Broly listened to goku.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qr5oYZGAp4) The other manga is my original story in the dragon ball world but alternate from the Canon story. Another manga is base off of my custom created character from Dragon ball Xenoverse 2 a game were you are in the dragon ball story. The final one is a cross-over with Dragon ball super and DC's Injustice with a few tweaks to it as well.
